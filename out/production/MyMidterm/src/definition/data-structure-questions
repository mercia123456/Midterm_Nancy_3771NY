Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer so
  that it can be retrieved and used most productively.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
B.Operations on Data Structures. The basic operations that are performed on data structures are as follows:
  Insertion: Insertion means addition of a new data element in a data structure.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
C.The name of areas are:Compiler Design,Operating System,Database Management System,
  Statistical analysis package,Numerical Analysis,Graphics,Artificial
  Intelligence,Simulation ae applied.

what is an Array?
D.An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements.
  Typically these elements are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
E.irst and Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is
  that Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable
  length Collection class.One more major difference between ArrayList and Array is that,
   you can not store primitives in ArrayList, it can only contain Objects.

what is LinkedList?
F.Linked List is a linear data structure.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
G.In array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value.
   In case of a linked list, each node/element points to the next, previous.

what is queue?
H.A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and
  removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

what is stack?
I.A stack is a conceptual structure consisting of a set of homogeneous elements and
  is based on the principle of last in first out (LIFO).

what is FIFO and LIFO?
J.The difference between FIFO and LIFO results from the order in which changing unit
  costs are removed from inventory and become the cost of goods sold. When the unit costs
  have increased, LIFO will result in a larger cost of goods sold and a smaller ending inventory compared with FIFO.

what is the order of complexity?
K.the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm,
  the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
L.The best case running time of an algorithm is the function defined by the
  minimum number of steps taken on any instance of size

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
M.The worst case arises when the element is at last position or not in the array,
  therefore we have to traverse the whole array giving n no. of repetitions over loop.

what is tree in data structure?
N. A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle.

what is graph in data structure?
O. A set of items connected by edges. Each item is called a vertex or node.
   Formally, a graph is a set of vertices and a binary relation between vertices, adjacency.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
P.There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java:
   Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Q.The major data structures used are as follows:

  · RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)

  · Network data model – Graph

  · Hierarchical data model – Trees

How HashMap works in java?
R.HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
S.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate
  that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index. This exception is thrown
   when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
T.There are multiple ways to copy elements from one array in Java e.g. you can
  manually copy elements by using a loop, create a clone of the array, use Arrays.
  copyOf() method or System.arrayCopy() to start copying elements from one array to
  another in Java.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
U.The difference between an array and a linked list is that an array
  is an index based data structure, every element is associated with an
  index whereas the linked list is a data structure that uses references.

What is DFS and BFS?
V.The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are
  the two algorithms used for traversing and searching a node in a graph.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
W.In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear
   order in which elements are linked one after the other. Conversely,
    non-linear data structure involves multiple levels.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
X.Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance
  or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Y.the number of objects is so large that some of them reside on external storage during the sort,
   it is called external sorting.Bucket sort
                                 Bubble sort
                                 Insertion sort
                                 Selection sort
                                 Heapsort
                                 Mergesort


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
