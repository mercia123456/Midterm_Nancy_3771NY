Please answer the below core-java Questions:

A.
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
* JDK is a superset of JRE, and contains everything that is in JRE,
  the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and
  applications. JRE provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other
  components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.

What is IDE?
* An IDE is a software development tool that is mainly used by
the developers to write and test the programs or software.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
* NetBeans is the most powerful open source free integrated development
  environment for Java and is used by professional developers for enterprise,
  web, mobile and desktop applications development.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
* A thread goes through various stages in its lifecycle.
 For example, a thread is born, started, runs, and then dies.

what is class?

* A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and
 the methods common to all objects of a certain kind.

What is object?
* Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology.
 examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your
 television set, your bicycle.

What is the entry point of an application?
* When a resource for an application entry point and
the entry point are both defined as part of an application,
the entry point controls access to the service provided by the resource.

Why main is static?
* This is neccesary because main() is called by
  the JVM before any objects are made.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
* The Object class, which is stored in the java.lang package,
is the ultimate superclass of all Java classes (except for Object ).
 Also, arrays extend Object.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
* Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find
  the executables. Classpath is an environment variable which is used by
  the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.ie in J2EE we give the path of jar files.
 2).PATH is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system

iables while
  creating a persistent byte stream for any instance of that class.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
* difference between while and do-while loops is that, in while loops,
  test expression is checked at first but, in do...while loop code is executed
  at first then the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
* An enum type is a special data type that enables
  for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.

What is Iterator?
* In computer programming, an iterator is an object
  that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
* In both C and C++, for example, int is one of several integer types.
  Some may be smaller than int, some may be larger, and some may be the same size,
  depending on the particular implementation you’re using.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
* The string is Immutable in Java because String objects are cached in String pool.
  Another reason of why String class is immutable could die due to HashMap.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
* Constructor chaining is the process of calling one
  constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
* he serial and parallel collectors cause a stop-the-world during the GC.
  a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC
  thread for the GC operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads
  for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
*JIT stands for ‘Joint Investigation Team’ & in Pakistan, currently,
 the term ‘JIT’ stands for the joint investigation team of Panama case.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
* Java objects reside in an area called the heap.
  The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase
  or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full,
  garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer
  used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
* the garbage collection process explicitly in the code.
  It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed
  that these calls will do the garbage collection.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
* The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory
  is used to store local variables and function call while heap memory is
  used to store objects in Java.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
* Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces,
   fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes,
   methods etc. at compile time.

what is multithreading in java?
* Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
* Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive
  access to a shared resource with multiple threads in Java.

What is Framework?
* A framework is a scaffold that you can you build applications around.
  A framework generally provides some base functionality which you can
  use and extend to make more complex applications from, there are frameworks
  for all sorts of things. Microsofts MVC framework is a good example of this.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
* Testing framework for Java which is available under a MIT License.
  Mockito allows programmers to create and test double objects (mock objects)
  in automated unit tests for the purpose of Test-driven Development (TDD) or
  Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
* JUnit provides an easier and readable approach to test known as Parameterized test.
  Both TestNG and JUnit supports parameterized test but differ in the way they define
  the parameter value.

What are the dependencies for this project?
* Dependencies are the relationships of the preceding tasks to the succeeding tasks.
  Tasks may have multiple preceding tasks and multiple succeeding tasks.

what is dependency injection in java?

*The dependency container, could analyze the dependencies of this class.
 With this analysis it is able to create an instance of the class and inject
 the objects into the defined dependencies,If dependency injection is used,
 a Java class can be tested in isolation.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
* Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic
  binding occurs during runtime.

What is Collections Framework?
* In JAVA, Collection framework is basically implementation of data structure.

What is Collection and Collections?
* Collection is a top level interface of java collection framework
  where as Collections is an utility class.

What is StringBuffer and String Builder?
* StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object .
  The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap.

What do you understand by Thread Safe?
* thread‐safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads,
  regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution of those threads
  by the runtime environment, and with no additional synchronization or other
  coordination on the part of the calling code.
